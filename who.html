                <p>
                    I’m Sarah Baca (don’t cha know) and I grew up in southwest Wyoming amoung a variety of sagebrush,
                    with what some say a mid-western accent and some Mormons in the mix. My upbringing was wild and tame
                    at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I played a Russian piano concerto with the Great Music West Orchestra at 15. I moved,
                    alone, from rural Wyoming to Washington D.C. to work for the U.S. House of Representatives for my
                    junior year of high school and from there I’ve lived in California, Colorado, Utah, Jackson Hole,
                    Wyoming (which really isn’t like the rest of Wyoming) Mt. Buller, Australia and now Oregon. I’ve
                    traveled to six of the seven continents, have snowboarded year round for three different years and
                    met Mohaumed Ali once. I’m a national champion snowboarder, a Human Rights Activist, musician,
                    hiker, biker, skier, writer, part-time mountaineer, a roller derby mama and a conesuer of the finest
                    yurts. I’ve lived a varied life. I don’t regret much of it and I only scream some days.
                </p>

                    As Walt Whitman puts it best, “I contain multitudes.”
                <p>We all do.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every step takes you closer to where you are going. For now I want to share my stories, my thoughts
                    and my love for the violent serenity of this life; in hopes of capturing that which makes us human.
