                <p>Nearly every time it rains and the gutters on the street fill with water, I am reminded of a
                    memory
                    of my mother. You see, my mom has always been an advocate for the environment. She was the first
                    person to enforce in my mind the idea of “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.”</p>
                <p>When we were young she had a tower of recycle bins in the garage where we would sort our
                    aluminum,
                    tin, plastic, glass and paper. Glass was on the bottom. Obviously. Once they would fill up, she
                    would load them in our Subaru and drive them over an hour to the nearest recycle center in
                    Ogden,
                    Utah. (Luckily, Granny and Tia lived there too.)</p>
                <p>So, like many things, my mom wanted to utilized everything to the max. Whether it was wearing our
                    hand-me-down clothes until they were in shreds, packing left overs in old margarine containers,
                    or
                    using scrap computer paper cut into quarters and stapled as note pads. We reused. it. up.
                </p>
                <p>One of mom’s biggest conservation efforts is with water. She informed us that it is likely that
                    we
                    will run out of drinkable water long before we run out of food. Only *3% of water on the planet
                    is
                    fresh water and a sizeable portion of that is frozen in the ice caps. We have always been
                    encouraged
                    not to mistake its convenience with its abundance.
                </p>
                <p>One summer water was scarce. We lived in the high alpine desert of southwest Wyoming, so to keep
                    our
                    Kentucky Bluegrass alive we had to water it supplementally. But why waste such a precious
                    resource
                    on mere aesthetics? Especially on the front lawn. Because of it’s proximity to the road, you
                    can’t
                    even use it that much.
                </p>

                <p>Well that summer my mom began rain harvesting water, if you can call it that. But in order to
                    harvest any water, it must rain. That year she bought sand bags and strategically put them in
                    the
                    gutter at the front of our house. Honestly, they were kind of annoying. The majority of the time
                    it
                    wasn’t even raining. You had to maneuver around them in order to park on the street and for a 16
                    year old learning to parallel park, it was not fun.
                </p>
                <p>One blessed day, the sandbags became less of a parking hazard and transformed themselves to serve
                    their one true purpose. The Heavens opened up and in traditional western fashion a raucous
                    thunderstorm took over our corner of the world. The skies were dark and ominous and once they
                    opened
                    up the street began to flood.
                </p>
                <p>It was a beautiful thing to watch. As the water rushed down the street, the U-shapes of the
                    sandbags
                    began to form little lakes. The street edge of the lawn was flooding nicely, however the water
                    didn’t extend to the thirst of the middle.
                </p>
                <p>My sister Melanie and I sat on the couch in our living room as it poured outside. Enjoying the
                    beauty of the storm from the comfort of our roof. Our mom must have been busy doing something
                    elsewhere in the house because at a certain point, she ran upstairs to the coat closet to grab
                    her
                    umbrella and ran outside through the garage.
                </p>
                <p>Mel and I were a little concerned because her umbrella was older than either of us and barely
                    opened. Umbrella’s don’t stand a chance in Wyoming. Now we were intrigued. We sat up on the
                    couch
                    peering out the front window. Mom goes running out into the yard with her rust colored, broken,
                    short, un-fully opened umbrella in one hand and a half-cut plastic milk jug in the other.
                </p>
                <p>She runs to the pools forming at the edge of the yard and begins furiously scooping half gallons
                    of
                    rainwater and throwing it to the middle of the lawn. Scoop after scoop, chucking water this way
                    and
                    that. We watch in awe. Her cut-off jean shorts and t-shirt beginning to soak through, but that
                    doesn’t stop her. That lawn needs a drink!
                </p>
                <p>As we kneel up on the couch poised at the window, watching this show intently; our neighbor Dale
                    peers out of her garage, daring to walk into the storm of her driveway to get a better look at
                    what’s going on next door. The look of pure bewilderment is still seared in my memory as she
                    shakes
                    her head slightly and walks back inside.
                </p>
                <p>Like most thunderstorms, it didn’t last long but the memory of my mom’s dedication to
                    conservation,
                    will last forever.

            <div class="time-bombs-text-container">
                <p>Life is funny, you know… in a ha-ha sort of way. Sometimes it folds back on you and it makes you
                    wonder what happened to those times?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You know; the “good ole’ ones.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sleep these days is precious. Once my boys go down, they are like little time bombs, ticking through
                    the few quiet hours of the night. Each second that passes is one second closer to when they go off,
                    disrupting any continuous thought or emotion. But in this solace of congregational, congested, face
                    down, snoring; I write about late nights for my own memory of such times; filled with cleavage for
                    aesthetics rather than sustenance.
                </p>
                <p>A night in the not so distant past, my friend and realistic confidante and I, sat up talking about
                    the joys of child birth. Cal hasn’t had the privilege of tearing your nether regions for the sake of
                    procreation yet; but she seems intrigued. As a nurse, she aids all women, regardless of race, class,
                    creed or national origin, in the art of holding your nipple like a hamburger and keeping wounds
                    sanitary near feces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My births have been fairly textbook; natural, full of breathing and primal meditations. However, my
                    hind end had more trouble than I remember reading about in biology. Anal fissures weren’t discussed
                    to me by my teachers or by ANY of my health care providers, but that didn’t stop it from splitting
                    after all of the pushing for life was accomplished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only one honest friend discussed the horrors of the postpartum ordeal. Her sweet and even tempered
                    voice told tales of flesh being torn apart and the searing pain that accompanies urine in a fresh
                    and bloody wound. Due to her honesty, I developed a rigorous consumption of liquids while in the
                    hospital, to 1) stay hydrated and 2) dilute my pee so much that it almost rinsed my gash rather than
                    contaminate it. With the latter being the more important of course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, this brings me to the evening Cal and I sat up chatting in the lamp light, enjoying adult
                    conversations in the stillness of night, as the time bombs slept. It was late, you know, like 11, so
                    we decided to call it. We quietly brushed our teeth in the bathroom and I walked her out to the
                    kitchen so I could drink my nightly warm glass of Miralax as my bedtime ritual. A mitigation effort
                    that is better than the sharp and shooting pain of that evil little fissure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can be honest with Cal. After all, she see’s people in all sorts of states. My honesty can
                    potentially help her with her own regularity postpartum and or help her patients to know that even
                    if you don’t take anything more than IB Profin for pain, you can still end up with a rock in your
                    bowels that doesn’t seem like your own body made it; nor has the capacity to expel it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we stand in the kitchen, mixing my warm laxative cocktail, a light knock at the door is heard. I
                    thought my sister, who had been staying the weekend with us, had possibly locked herself out. So,
                    not thinking, Cal and I answer it; Miralax bottle in hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the light of the porch stands a beautiful, hip young woman; obviously startled more by our
                    presence than we were of hers. She stammers “is this, uh, something something and uh something
                    else?” We laugh and say no, it must not be; and tell her she should try side street behind the
                    house.
                    <br>
                    <br>She turns off and into the night, quickly departing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I look at Cal and she looks back at me, both of us smiling. It’s cute that some young thing thought
                    she was going to a college party and found us instead.
                    <br>
                    <br>Maybe we could have been the party she was hoping for in years past; instead she ended up on a
                    dark porch talking to two women who were unwilling to share their company or their Costco size
                    bottle of hydro-osmotive laxative.
                    <br>
                    <br>Late nights and white powder aren’t what it used to be.

            <div class="pioneer-text-container">
                <p>I have always known that my ancestors came across the plains in covered wagons. It seemed like
                    everyone’s did the way my church talked about it, but growing up and moving beyond religion, I
                    realize that most did not. </p>
                <p>I remember stories about my great great great grandma burying her baby on the plains. They had to
                    bury her under the trail where the wagons traveled to prevent coyotes and other scavengers from
                    getting her. I remember my mom telling us that they watched for hours as the wagons in their party
                    left and rolled over her baby, knowing they would never see her or this place where she was laid to
                    rest again. </p>
                <p>I can’t imagine leaving your home with what you hope is enough food and water for a journey that is
                    unknown. Heading west, trekking towards what you hope is a better life, not knowing what lies ahead,
                    only knowing what you leave behind.

                </p>
                <p>As a teenager, we did a pioneer trek on the original trail the Saints took to the Salt Lake Valley.
                    It was southwest Wyoming in July, so the weather was variable. My mom had sewn skirts, aprons,
                    pantaloons and bonnets for my sister and I, and dropped us off at the church early one morning
                    knowing full well that she would pick us up in a few day’s time from the same location healthy and
                    happy, all the better for having experienced such a venture.

                </p>
                <p>Upon arriving they divided us into groups or “families” separating us from our own family unit in
                    order to rely on others from our Stake. It was nerve racking; I didn’t really know anyone else from
                    my arbitrary family. What I really wanted was to be with my OWN sister and rely on someone that
                    actually meant something to me, but I could see what they were going for and tried to play along.
                </p>
                <p>We were assigned a 5lb bag of sugar, that was our newborn baby we called “Butch” we swaddled him,
                    double checked our supply list and headed out to the caravans. In this instance, it wasn’t Calistoga
                    wagons, but suburban’s, vans and trailers that transported our handcart company and all our supplies
                    to the trail.

                </p>
                <p>We headed off into the vast expanse of the high alpine desert, where the harsh conditions permit few
                    forms of life. The rolling horizon was dry and only ragged sagebrush and sparse tufts of prairie
                    grass filled our young eyes. Modern conveniences, transportation, protection and heating left us
                    somewhere east of Fort Bridger, Wyoming. Here the trail, over 100 years later, was still etched into
                    the landscape; two tracks, dead from thousands of wheels that rolled over them. </p>
                <p>Our energy was high as each “family” loaded their own handcarts, wrapped our sugar babies and set off
                    on the plains. Smiles and laughter was heard as hundreds of excited youth started our pretend
                    journey, 150 years after our ancestors. I remember thinking that by the time my great great great
                    grandma got here, her spirits wouldn’t have been so high. We had the advantage of knowing there was
                    an end in sight. Our leaders couldn’t let us die out here. We would spend a night or two under the
                    stars and then return safely to the arms of our parents and a hot meal. </p>
                <p>Our handcart company set out, hundreds of youth, a few brave chaperons and a piece of a historic
                    journey we hoped to recreate. We held hands, hugged baby sugar Butch tight and sang songs like the
                    Saints Go Marching In and the like. Our bonnets kept the high elevation sun from our eyes and we
                    walked in the dust of thousands of pioneers. </p>
                <p>The sweet jerky and hard tack were pretty gross if I’m totally honest, but I knew it wouldn’t kill me
                    to play along. I remember wanting to trade another family for some peppered jerky, because Sweet was
                    the absolute worst, but instead I ate it because that was part of the game.</p>
                <p>It was a long walk. I remember looking to the far horizon as our handcart company stretched along the
                    plains and wishing myself to the front, over and over. Knowing that that’s not how it worked, but
                    hoping none the less; and wondering how often my ancestors did the same. As we climbed, the sage
                    greens and light browns of the prairie grew grey as the sky darkened above us. The angry clouds
                    intent on helping us feel the pain of our ancestors, closed in.</p>
                <p>As we ascended, the pressure was building, swirling and darkening. The rain came first, like tears of
                    the past, breaking down our hope and resilience as our crisp bonnets melted and our heavy cotton
                    dresses absorbed the sky. Up we continued, the thunder growling and reminding us of the reality of
                    mortality and the fact that our re-creation included metal handcarts, as the lost art of
                    Wheelwrights died with the advent of tires.

                </p>
                <p>The lightning began to crash all around us, especially at the top of the pass. I remember looking to
                    the front of our train and now being grateful that I was closer to the back. We kept going, because
                    what else can you do? It’s 1997 and no one had a cell phone and there certainly wasn’t coverage out
                    in the middle of the Oregon trail. The snow and sleet began. Our dresses froze and each icy step hit
                    the back of your legs like nails in tender flesh. Screams of terror and distress couldn’t be heard
                    as the Wyoming wind howled the cries of the past.</p>
                <p>As we entered camp, truly exhausted we were jubilant to be together. Now in the safety of our circles
                    we could smile and laugh about our “harrowing journey.” Our dresses dried around the campfires and
                    we slept under the clear and constantly changing western skies.</p>
                <p>The morning sun brought a renewed sense of strength and determination. We had our ration of hard tack
                    and sweet jerky and set out. The rest of the trip was less memorable. At some point, we passed the
                    point where the Saints split from the Oregon trail and headed towards the Salt Lake Valley, which
                    seemed incredibly significant. I still remember the sky and the horizon where the Y was. </p>
                <p>Baby Butch died on the trail. We had to bury our sugar sack without proper shovels and leave him for
                    the ants because coyotes don’t have much of a sweet tooth. My bonnet never had the same amount of
                    starch and the dirt from our skirts had to be hosed off by my mom. </p>
                <p>It was a wild experience and I am so glad I was able to do it. I can’t imagine how our leaders felt
                    as the lightning crashed all around us with our metal carts, it was a liability nightmare. But now
                    as I enjoy some Pie and Beer on Pioneer Day I smile and laugh, knowing that we are probably the
                    softest generation to ever exist. </p>
                <p>Here’s to cell phones, airplanes, GPS, quick dry clothes, and peppered jerky. Happy Pioneer Day
                    y’all!

                    about a time

                    outside of town
                    we decided to take what wasn’t ours,
                    to get to a place
                    we had never been.
                </p>
                <p>Along the banks of the Bennewah,
                    we broke into the Country Club
                    and stole their Crown.
                </p>
                <p>We walked with the moonlight,
                    up the dirt road,
                    to the familiar field
                    where the baptism in the Royal

                    that place of initiation.

                <p>Under the stars of an Idaho sky
                    we drank…
                    we drank until we fell down

                    out of the forest,
                    to take the sprouts that were fresh.
                </p>
                <p>Their steps were felt
                    as much as they were heard;
                    as they grazed
                    the virginal foliage.
                </p>
                <p>Once we had drank all of our potion,
                    we laid there under it’s spell;
                    breathing the cool summer air.
                </p>
                <p>We spoke of times past,
                    we spoke of the present,
                    until we got to now.
                </p>
                <p>We wondered why it had
                    taken so long to get to

                <p>I would dance under the moonlight,
                    listen to the deer in the alfalfa,
                    sip a sip of our potion,
