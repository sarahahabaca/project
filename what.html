                    <h2>Sandbagging</h2>
                    <p>Nearly every time it rains and the gutters on the street fill with water, I am reminded of a
                        memory
                        of my mother. You see, my mom has always been an advocate for the environment. She was the first
                        person to enforce in my mind the idea of “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.”</p>
                    <p>When we were young she had a tower of recycle bins in the garage where we would sort our
                        aluminum,
                        tin, plastic, glass and paper. Glass was on the bottom. Obviously. Once they would fill up, she
                        would load them in our Subaru and drive them over an hour to the nearest recycle center in
                        Ogden,
                        Utah. (Luckily, Granny and Tia lived there too.)</p>
                    <p>So, like many things, my mom wanted to utilized everything to the max. Whether it was wearing our
                        hand-me-down clothes until they were in shreds, packing left overs in old margarine containers,
                        or
                        using scrap computer paper cut into quarters and stapled as note pads. We reused. it. up.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of mom’s biggest conservation efforts is with water. She informed us that it is likely that
                        we
                        will run out of drinkable water long before we run out of food. Only *3% of water on the planet
                        is
                        fresh water and a sizeable portion of that is frozen in the ice caps. We have always been
                        encouraged
                        not to mistake its convenience with its abundance.
                    </p>
                    <p>One summer water was scarce. We lived in the high alpine desert of southwest Wyoming, so to keep
                        our
                        Kentucky Bluegrass alive we had to water it supplementally. But why waste such a precious
                        resource
                        on mere aesthetics? Especially on the front lawn. Because of it’s proximity to the road, you
                        can’t
                        even use it that much.
                    </p>

                    <p>Well that summer my mom began rain harvesting water, if you can call it that. But in order to
                        harvest any water, it must rain. That year she bought sand bags and strategically put them in
                        the
                        gutter at the front of our house. Honestly, they were kind of annoying. The majority of the time
                        it
                        wasn’t even raining. You had to maneuver around them in order to park on the street and for a 16
                        year old learning to parallel park, it was not fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>One blessed day, the sandbags became less of a parking hazard and transformed themselves to serve
                        their one true purpose. The Heavens opened up and in traditional western fashion a raucous
                        thunderstorm took over our corner of the world. The skies were dark and ominous and once they
                        opened
                        up the street began to flood.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was a beautiful thing to watch. As the water rushed down the street, the U-shapes of the
                        sandbags
                        began to form little lakes. The street edge of the lawn was flooding nicely, however the water
                        didn’t extend to the thirst of the middle.
                    </p>
                    <p>My sister Melanie and I sat on the couch in our living room as it poured outside. Enjoying the
                        beauty of the storm from the comfort of our roof. Our mom must have been busy doing something
                        elsewhere in the house because at a certain point, she ran upstairs to the coat closet to grab
                        her
                        umbrella and ran outside through the garage.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mel and I were a little concerned because her umbrella was older than either of us and barely
                        opened. Umbrella’s don’t stand a chance in Wyoming. Now we were intrigued. We sat up on the
                        couch
                        peering out the front window. Mom goes running out into the yard with her rust colored, broken,
                        short, un-fully opened umbrella in one hand and a half-cut plastic milk jug in the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>She runs to the pools forming at the edge of the yard and begins furiously scooping half gallons
                        of
                        rainwater and throwing it to the middle of the lawn. Scoop after scoop, chucking water this way
                        and
                        that. We watch in awe. Her cut-off jean shorts and t-shirt beginning to soak through, but that
                        doesn’t stop her. That lawn needs a drink!
                    </p>
                    <p>As we kneel up on the couch poised at the window, watching this show intently; our neighbor Dale
                        peers out of her garage, daring to walk into the storm of her driveway to get a better look at
                        what’s going on next door. The look of pure bewilderment is still seared in my memory as she
                        shakes
                        her head slightly and walks back inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>Like most thunderstorms, it didn’t last long but the memory of my mom’s dedication to
                        conservation,
                        will last forever.
                    </p>
