                        In a world filled with 15 second clips, stories or posts of kids, cats, dance challenges and
                        pranks it seems like we only skim the surface of who or what we are. I’ve written my entire
                        life, mostly to make sense of my world, organize thoughts or vent frustration, but I rarely
                        share it. When I look back at the most significant works that have influenced me, I see
                        that it’s things that capture the human experience and the vulnerability that comes with
                        expressing our story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I read once that we are innately creative beings; yet we don’t create because we’re afraid it
                        isn’t “good.”</p>
                    <p>Who ever said it needed to be good?</p>
                    <p>Create to create.</p>
                    <p>Create to express yourself.</p>
                    <p>Create to find a place in this world.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to collaborate,<a href="who.html"> reach out.</a> If you want a place to display
                        your art, <a href="who.html"> reach out.</a> Let’s create a world where we share ourselves more
                        than our selfies.
